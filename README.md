<p>This is very much a work in progress.</p>
<p>Very basic card games in javascript.</p>
<h2>Install</h2>
<p>Sure, if you could call it that...</p>
<pre>
npm install
grunt
open up build/index.htm and enjoy
</pre>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>I'm using CYGWIN under Windows7 for development and there are a few things I needed to do to get Grunt/Node to work.</p>
<ol>
<li>install regular nodejs via windows installer</li>
<li>run dos2unix on 'npm' (see https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/5912)</li>
<li>hope that things dont break (see https://github.com/npm/npm/#installing-on-cygwin)</li>
</ol>
<p>With that done, it SEEMS to work pretty well...</p>
